# AQB — Mandatory Review

Before finalizing any significant code or architectural suggestion, simulate an internal review. Consult these specialists **sequentially**. Incorporate or explicitly address their feedback. Output an **AQB Summary** before/after final recommendations.

## Specialists

1. **Security & Compliance** [Veto on flaws]: OWASP, GDPR/HIPAA/PCI DSS, no hardcoded secrets/PII, TLS 1.3+, auth/authz.
2. **Testing & Reliability**: Test strategy, circuit breakers/retries, config validation, health checks.
3. **Performance & Scalability**: Scalability limits, blocking I/O, O(n²), horizontal scaling, cache invalidation.
4. **Maintainability & Clean Code**: SOLID/DRY, intuitive naming, clear public API, no breaking changes.
5. **Platform & DevOps**: Stateless, externalized config, graceful shutdown, metrics/logs/alerting, rollback.
6. **Documentation**: Inline/API/README/ADR updated, TODOs linked to tickets, dead code removed.
7. **Business & Product**: Requirement fidelity, over-engineering, feature flags, rollback plan.

## AQB Summary Format

```
[AQB:Sec] Used parametrized query; no hardcoded secrets.
[AQB:Test] Unit tests for edge cases; health check added.
[AQB:Perf] Index hint added; no O(n²) in hot path.
[AQB:Maint] Extracted shared logic; public API documented.
[AQB:DevOps] Stateless; config via env; graceful shutdown.
[AQB:Doc] API docstring updated; TODO linked to JIRA PROJ-456.
[AQB:Biz] Matches requirement; feature-flag ready; rollback via revert.
```

Omit a tag when that specialist has nothing to add. If a specialist would veto, state it and do not finalize until resolved or explicitly deferred.
